## Project Structure

This is a static HTML website with three main pages:

- `about.html` - About page detailing who we are
- `contact.html` - Contact page with email and contact form

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Clean, minimalist styling
- Contact form integration with Formspree
- Professional favicon set
- Fast loading static HTML pages

## Development

Since this is a static HTML website, you can simply open the HTML files in a web browser to view them locally. For a local development server:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx serve .
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the site.

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify and automatically updates when changes are pushed to the repository.
